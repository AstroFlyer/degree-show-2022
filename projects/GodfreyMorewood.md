## Project Description
Visual disturbances frollowing a brain injuiry are fairly common. They can present in anumber of ways including cognitive neglect and unilateral hemianopia, the focuses of this project. This project's mission statement is: 

“Create a “Virtual Reality”-based program to aid in the recovery and rehabilitation of brain injury victims suffering from cognitive visual disturbances, such as unilateral visuospatial neglect.”

with the following targets: 

•	To provide a safe and accessible VR rehabilitation program. 
•	To modernise and gamify current rehabilitation exercises. 
•	To deliver a polished and ready-for-market product. 
•	To provide a single platform for multiple rehabilitation exercises to reduce workload on Occupational Therapists. 


## Project Findings
A Functioning VR-based program was condstructed for the Oculus Quest 2 platform. This program was based upon current exercises and demands along with research previously conducted from institutions globally. Its modular design allows easy expansion and single point of use for multiple exercises.
